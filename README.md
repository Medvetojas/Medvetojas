My name is **Medvetojas** and this is my personal `README.md` file.
Here I can include some information about me, while providing statistics about my profile and work.

* I'm currently learning **Computer Science** at the **University of Miskolc**.
* I have some experience in **C**, much more experience in **Java**, and I also did some basic **HTML/JS** stuff in the past.
* Besides my interest in programming, you can mostly find me playing League of Legends or CS:GO.
